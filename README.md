# Travel Dapp

Travel Dapp is a decentralised application (DApp) that offers users the ability to book travel using Ethereum blockchain technology.
The main objective of Travel Dapp is to provide a secure, transparent and decentralised travel booking experience, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries such as travel agencies or centralised booking platforms.

***Attention: the platform supports the Sepolia testnet, Ethereum mainnet and Polygon! In order to test dapp, you can receive a sum of test tokens from [here](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia). You also need a wallet to be able to connect to dapp and make transactions***
